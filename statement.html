  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p> My name is Gabriel Venegas and I am a Junior at San Jose State University. I am actually a psych major but i have always been interesting in art as a whole. As an artist, I care about making people feel things. Ive always been one to who has been more in tune with his feelings. Feelings  are something I try to portray in my art, whether it is my own, or invoking someone elses. I also, either intentionally or unintentionally add humor to my projects.</p>
  <p>The approaches that i take towards my work reflect who I am by me being so closely involved. I am able to make them my own, either a mix of humor or just feelings all together. Humor has always been something that I enjoy, making people laugh or laughing myself is always something that I enjoy doing, so to present this in my projects as best as I can, gives the viewer a look into me as an artist, and me as a person. I explore the ideas that I have and try to make them as me as possible. </p>
