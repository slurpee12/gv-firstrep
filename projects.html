<p>“Growing”, Installation with cutouts, videos being played inside<p>
<p>I used cutouts of the boxes of old laptops that were at the top of their game at the time. The videos being projected into the cutouts are random internet videos, that range from happy and sweet, the animal ones, then they go to unnerving and uncomfortable to watch such as the bending of the finger, the guy eating bugs, etc. This ties in with the progression of the laptop screens as means to show that the more we innovate the technology we have, the more we will be able to accomplish anything.<p>
